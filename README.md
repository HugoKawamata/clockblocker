## What is Clockblocker?

Clockblocker is a tool for visually planning out your time. It was inspired by
other visual clocks that are designed to help neurodivergent people make sense
of passing time. Clockblocker builds on this idea by allowing you to plan an
entire 24 hours worth of time at once.

- Two clocks represent the 12 hours each in AM and PM
- As the time in the day passes, the "pie" gets smaller - this allows you to
  see how much time you have left
- Add "blocks" of time to the clocks to plan the rest of the day

## What can I use it for?

- Autistic, ADHD, and other neurodivergent people can use Clockblocker to
  visually represent the time left in their day and plan out personal time.
- At work, increase your productivity by blocking out your time.
- At home, use Clockblocker to ensure you're keeping on top of your study
  and leaving enough time for yourself and your hobbies.

## Where did Clockblocker come from?

I'm a programmer with many hobbies including writing, drawing, and learning
a language (which is a time consuming hobby that requires constant attention).
I also recently found out I may have autism, and was recommended by a friend to
Google "autism clocks". When I saw the image results, I was so excited because
they seemed perfect for managing my time, but with just one issue - those
clocks are _stopwatches_, and I wanted a 12 hour clock. So I made this!

### Donations?

I have a well paying software job, so although I'd be honoured if you
appreciated this little app enough to want to donate to me, I don't
need the money. Instead, send what money you would have sent me to
[Effective Altruism](https://effectivealtruism.org.au/donate/) (they try to save the most life
per dollar given).
